title: Translations

p. I'm not a professional translator, nor do I particularly aspire to be given my disabilities, but despite those same issues, here is a list of the non-dialogue translations I've done. If you would like me to do similar work, please contact me; I can be reached <a href="mailto:kiyoshi.aman@gmail.com">via e-mail</a>.

p. All of my translations are my original work and are released under the Creative Commons Attribution/Share Alike/Non-Commercial 3.0 license; other translations alongside, if any, are copyright by their respective creators.
