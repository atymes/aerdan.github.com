title: Translations
---

I've translated non-dialogue text for a number of games, and alongside my translations are 'official' translations for comparison purposes. My process typically involves transcription and translation before I include the official translations; this is so that I'm not distracted by others' translations as I do my own. I've played most or all of these games, so in some cases I will use the official translation's terms when I can't think of a better one on my own.

If you have non-dialogue text for me to translate, "please contact me":mailto:kiyoshi.aman@gmail.com. Be warned: I don't do image translations of kanji at this time unless rubi text (also known as furigana) is supplied.
