title: Chessa Usage
---

p. Chessa's commands may be prefixed with a period (.) for both public *and* private use. The usage information for each command is based on this syntax.

p. Commands marked as @Dicebot: Yes.@ support comments using the semicolon (;), and additionally support modifiers appended to the command. Those modifiers are as follows:

* @.<Command>-to <Target>@ Executes @<Command>@ as normal and PMs the output to @<Target>@ and yourself.
* @.<Command>-as <Victim>@ Executes @<Command>@ as normal and replaces your nick in the output with @<Victim>@. Note that @.<Command>-as@ only performs this replacement if the command is used in public; otherwise it behaves like any other PMed command.
